\subsection{Results}
The overall result of the developed system is a web interface, Non-Fungible Token (NFT), and interoperable smart contract. The following sections detail each result of the developed system.

\subsubsection{Web Interface}
The initial web interface displays a list of NFT collections that are available for minting. The NFT can initially be owned by the address that mints it first, and ownership can be transferred to another address. At the initial dashboard, users must press the \emph{Connect Wallet} button, which will then connect to the Metamask Wallet account. From this connection, users obtain an address that can be used to mint NFT tokens. This intuitive interface simplifies the process of connecting to the blockchain, ensuring that even users new to the world of NFTs can easily navigate and understand the steps involved in acquiring and managing digital assets. Moreover, the dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, providing clear and concise information, which aids in fostering a seamless interaction between the user and the blockchain technology.

  \end{figure}

  In the image referred to as \ref{fig:homepage}, the initial homepage view is presented when users click the home button on the top navigation bar. This website features several pages accessible through the navigation bar, such as Home, Create, My Listed Items, and My Purchases. These interfaces become available once the user has successfully connected the web to the Metamask Wallet, evidenced by the display of the Metamask Wallet address on the upper right of the navigation bar. On this initial screen, users can view NFTs that have been uploaded for purchase or minting. However, if no NFTs have been uploaded yet, the display will only show the message "\emph{Loading...}".

    \label{fig:createpage}
    \end{figure}

    In the image referred to as \ref{fig:createpage}, the create page is displayed. This page allows users to upload an NFT in the form of an image to the website. Once uploaded, the NFT will appear on both the home page and the my listed items page. Additionally, any NFT uploaded here will also be directly available for other users to view and interact with, enhancing the visibility and accessibility of newly minted NFTs within the platform. This integration ensures that NFT creators can immediately showcase their digital assets to potential buyers, facilitating a seamless transition from creation to sale.

    \end{figure}
  
    In the image referenced as \ref{fig:listingpage}, the my listed items page is shown. This page allows users to view the NFTs they have uploaded when they used the create function. However, if no NFTs have been uploaded yet, the page will display the message "\emph{There are no listed items yet}". This setup ensures that users can easily track and manage their digital assets directly from their dashboard once they have engaged in creating and listing new NFTs.

    % Label referensi dari gambar yang diinputkan
    \label{fig:purchasepage}
    \end{figure}
  
    In the image referenced as \ref{fig:purchasepage}, the display of the my purchase page is shown. This page is designed specifically to allow users to view all NFTs they have acquired through purchases on the main page of the platform. Once a purchase is made, the NFTs are listed on this page, providing a visual display and details of each NFT owned. Additionally, this page offers a transfer ownership function, which enables the owner to transfer the ownership of an NFT to another user with a different address. This feature is crucial for supporting flexibility and liquidity in NFT trading in the market. However, if the user has not made any purchases, the page will display the message "\emph{No purchases}", indicating that there are no NFTs available to display or transfer.

\subsubsection{Smart Contract}
In the development of blockchain-based applications, integrating the smart contract with user interfaces such as React.js becomes crucial. The smart contract built using Solidity can be deployed on Ethereum testnets, such as the Sepolia Testnet, which provides an environment similar to the Ethereum mainnet but without requiring high transaction fees.

The deployment process is carried out where the smart contract will be deployed to several blockchain networks, but for this testing, only the Sepolia testnet is used. During the deployment process, a gas or fee will be charged, which can be paid using Ethereum in the Metamask wallet. Details of this transaction can be seen on Etherscan.

\subsubsection{Non-Fungible Token (NFT)}
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) also undergo several stages before they can be stored in The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and then be published on OpenSea test net. In this thesis work, Pinata is used as a platform to upload NFT photos and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data so that it can be minted as a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) on the smart contract. This is necessary so that the minted NFT has an image that can be viewed on OpenSea.

\subsection{Testing Features of Smart Contract Interoperability}
The testing expectations from the smart contract system include the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users can mint NFT tokens, after which the ownership of these NFTs can be viewed on the test net platform OpenSea.

    \item Users from different Networks can communicate with each other, and the ownership of the NFT tokens can move from user A on network A' to user B on network B'.
\end{itemize}

Here is the data regarding the wallet used in testing:

\begin{table}[htbp]

      \hline
      \end{tabular}    
  }
\end{table}

The following are the steps of testing the smart contract system that will be conducted:

\begin{itemize}
    \item User A will mint an NFT first

    \begin{figure} [H] \centering
    % Name of the image file
    \frame{\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{gambar/riwayat_transaksi.jpeg}}
    % Caption for the image

    \label{fig:minting}
    \end{figure}

    \item The details on Etherscan can also be seen in the image below, showing details like the transaction hash, block, and the type of token, which is ERC-721.

    % Reference label for the image
    \label{fig:detail_transaction_etherscan}
    \end{figure}

    \item Then, on Etherscan, the details of the NFT that has been minted can be seen as in the following image

    \begin{figure} [H] \centering
    % Name of the image file
    \frame{\includegraphics[scale=0.165]{gambar/detail_nft_etherscan.jpeg}}
    % Caption for the image
    \caption{NFT Details on Etherscan}
    % Reference label for the image
    \label{fig:detail_nft_etherscan}
    \end{figure}

    \item After the process is successful, the NFT that has been minted can be seen on the platform OpenSea. In this test case, the minted NFT is "Letter D".

    \begin{figure} [H] \centering
    % Name of the image file
    \frame{\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{gambar/nft_pada_opensea.jpeg}}
    % Caption for the image
    \caption{NFT on OpenSea}
    % Reference label for the image
    \label{fig:nft_opensea}
    \end{figure}

    \item After the NFT is created, the next step is to lock the NFT to be sent to user B on network B'. The function of locking is to ensure that the token data is not changed during the transfer process, maintaining the trust and authenticity of the NFT data. It is also useful to signal to all related parties (users, smart contracts on other networks) that the token is undergoing a transfer process, and operations on the token should be suspended until the process is completed.

    \begin{figure} [H] \centering
    % Name of the image file

    % Caption for the image
    \caption{Lock Token function details on Etherscan}
    % Reference label for the image
    \label{fig:locktoken}
    \end{figure}

    \item After completing the lock token process, then the bridge transfer function can be executed. This function facilitates the secure transfer of NFTs between blockchains by ensuring that the NFT is locked during the transfer process and providing transparent visibility of the transfer event through recorded events. This is a key component in building interoperable applications that allow digital assets to move across blockchain ecosystems.

    \begin{figure} [H] \centering
    % Name of the image file
    \frame{\includegraphics[scale=0.5  ]{gambar/bridge_transfer.jpeg}}
    % Caption for the image
    \caption{Bridge transfer parameters}
    % Reference label for the image
    \label{fig:bridge_transfer}
    \end{figure}

    \item In the image \ref{fig:bridge_transfer}, there are two parameters: "\texttt{"\_to"}", used to receive the parameter address of user B, and "\texttt{"\_tokenId"}" to receive arguments from the NFT token. After the transaction is executed, it will be followed by payment on the Metamask Wallet.

    % Caption for the image
    \caption{Payment on Metamask Wallet}
    % Reference label for the image
    \label{fig:metamask_payment}
    \end{figure}

    \item After the transaction is successful, the record of the transaction is stored on the blockchain and can be viewed on Etherscan as shown in the image below.

    \begin{figure} [H] \centering
    % Name of the image file
    \frame{\includegraphics[scale=0.20]{gambar/detail_pada_etherscan.jpeg}}

    \caption{Details on Etherscan}
    % Reference label for the image
    \label{fig:details_etherscan}
    \end{figure}

    \item On Etherscan, details of the NFT can also be checked for ownership. As seen from the image \ref{fig:detail_nft_etherscan}, the owner of NFT \#4 is the address of user A on the Sepolia Ethereum Testnet, then in the image below, after successfully performing the bridge transfer, the ownership changes to user B on the BNB Chain Testnet.
