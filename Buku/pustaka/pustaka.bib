TITLE = {CCIO: A Cross-Chain Interoperability Approach for Consortium Blockchains Based on Oracle},
JOURNAL = {Sensors},
VOLUME = {23},
YEAR = {2023},
NUMBER = {4},
ARTICLE-NUMBER = {1864},
URL = {https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/4/1864},

ISSN = {1424-8220},
ABSTRACT = {Cross-chain interoperability can expand the ability of data interaction and value circulation between different blockchains, especially the value interaction and information sharing between industry consortium blockchains. However, some current public blockchain cross-chain technologies or data migration schemes between consortium blockchains need help to meet the consortium blockchain requirements for efficient two-way data interaction. The critical issue to solve in cross-chain technology is improving the efficiency of cross-chain exchange while ensuring the security of data transmission outside the consortium blockchain. In this article, we design a cross-chain architecture based on blockchain oracle technology. Then, we propose a bidirectional information cross-chain interaction approach (CCIO) based on the former architecture, we novelly improve three traditional blockchain oracle patterns, and we combine a mixture of symmetric and asymmetric keys to encrypt private information to ensure cross-chain data security. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CCIO approach can achieve efficient and secure two-way cross-chain data interactions and better meet the application needs of large-scale consortium blockchains.},

abstract = {Web3, the next generation web, promises a decentralized and democratized internet that puts users in control of their data and online identities. However, Web3 faces significant challenges, including scalability, interoperability, regulatory compliance, and energy consumption. To address these challenges, this review paper provides a comprehensive analysis of Web3, including its key advancements and implications, as well as an overview of its major applications in Decentralized Applications (DApps), Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs), Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and Supply Chain Management and Provenance Tracking. The paper also discusses the potential social and economic impact of Web3, as well as its integration with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and smart cities. This article then discusses importance of zero-trust architecture for Web3. Ultimately, this review highlights the importance of Web3 in shaping the future of the internet and provides insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.}
